Reasons why this project is awesome:<br/>
1) It is almost instagram.<br/>
Proper authentication(with hashing, salting of passwords, and use of session cookies).<br/>
Creating and deleting accounts. <br/>
Following, unfollowing, and exploration of friends. <br/>
Upload images to make posts, and delete posts. <br/>
Like, unlike, comment, uncomment posts. <br/>
2) Painless to set it up.<br/>
Making heavy use of bash scripts and python virtual enviroment allowed setting uniform environtment among developers quite simple.
3) Readable code. <br/>
Usage of pydocstyle, pycodestyle, and eslinter forced beautiful code.
