<p>
    This was my senior year team project and I was responsible for the backend.<br/>
    The Problem: When you travel to a city, you don't fully know which places to visit in which order and at what time.<br/>
    A Route: Series of GPS locations that can be traversed by other people in that order. Creators of a route can commentate the route with guidelines and pictures.<br/>
    The App Idea: Users can create and share route on our application, local places can put adds on routes, and let creators get portion of the ad reventue.<br/>
    Implementation choices:
